(This article is a work in progress)

Since 2014 OpenFn's Global Services Team has helped hundreds of organizations
get started on their data automation joruneys.

In this section we have included the process/workflow we follow when embarking
on the design phase of a new project.

Let's start with a question:

### What is "data integration"?

The term "data integration" is thrown around a lot and many people are
intimidated by it. Don't be.

When thinking of "data integrations," you might be thinking of a developer
sitting behind a computer screen writing code to send data between two database
systems. While this is part of the story, it isn't the whole story. Data
integrations can definitely be technical, particularly if there is automation involved, but
what "data integration" really means is a combination of both technical and
business/human processes to combine data from different sources to create
meaningful and valuable information.

:::tip

A data integration is not just the tecnhical process of connecting information, but it's also the business and
human process that is involved with transferring data from one tool to another
and making this data source useful and meaningful.

An integration is **only** as valuable as the insights it's output provide.

## Multiple technologies to get the job done

<!-- Lots of different tools that each serve unique purpose and often times we need to connect this data.Your organization is probably using multiple tools to get the job done. -->


<!-- show diagram of lots of tools -->

## Defining you data process

<!-- What is your current data process? -->

<!-- Take a look at the tools you are already using. -->
