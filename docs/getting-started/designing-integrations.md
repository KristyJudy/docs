Since 2014, OpenFn's Global Services Team has helped hundreds of organizations
get started on their data automation journeys. In this section we have included
the process/workflow we follow when embarking on the design phase of a new
project.

Let's start with a question:

### What is "data integration"?

The term "data integration" is thrown around a lot and many people are
intimidated by it. Don't be. Put simply, data integration means bringing
together different bits of information.

When thinking about data integration, you might envision a developer sitting
behind a computer screen, writing code to move huge data sets between two
databases. While this is _part_ of the story, it isn't the whole story. Data
integration often involves a technical component, but there's an awful lot of
non-technical design, planning, and analysis work that must be put in to combine
data from different sources and create meaningful and valuable information.

:::tip

Data integration is not just the technical process of connecting bits of
information; it's also the business and human processes that are involved in
transferring _meaning_ from one user (or group of users) to another. Far more
important than having a `patient_id` show up in System B is have the people who
use System A and System B come to agreement on what a `patient` is in the first
place and why anyone should be sharing their `id`!

An integration is **only** as valuable as the processes or analyses it enables.

### Multiple technologies to get the job done

You are probably viewing this page because your organization is using multiple
technologies to get your work done.

Perhaps you are using Open Data Kit (ODK) or SurveyCTO for mobile data
collection and Salesforce or dhis2 as a management-information-system (MIS).
Perhaps you are taking advantage of the powerful analytics and visualization
capabilities of Metabase, Tableau or PowerBI. You might even be using an SMS
service like telerivet or nexmo to stay connected with patients, customers, or
employees.

While there are lots of different tools that serve valuable purposes for their
various user groups, those purpose are often related and we find ourselves in a
position where we need to connect the data that's in those different tools we
use.

If we are administering surveys using ODK, we might need to send metadata to a
management system like Salesforce where we can analyze it, report on it and
share it with other members of our teamâ€”maybe tracking the progress of a large
study.

In connecting these different tools we set up different data integration
processes that can be automated, or it can be a more manual approach with
someone manually reviewing surveys and then manually entering it into a database
system, or a combination of both approaches.

Whenever we think about introducing a new tool to our set of tools that our
organization is using or thinking about how can we better streamline this data
integration process and how we share info between tools, it's really important
to sit down with a pen and paper and map out the data process.

## Defining your data process

The first question we ask new clients is **"what is your current data
process?"**

To illustrate how this works, let's create a hypothetical scenario:

- In Ethiopia a global health iNGO is using CommCare for mobile data collection
  and case management. The iNGO's community health workers (CHWs) are in the
  field capturing patient data on their mobile devices. For national reporting
  purposes this CommCare data gets uploaded into Ethiopia's dhis2 database so
  key health indicators can be monitored.

With the basic details of the scenario established, let's draw our first rough
sketch of the current process.

Great! We can now visually see, in a very basic way, what's going on with our
data, but a lot of the critical details related to the current process are
missing. To draw a great diagram and to gain a fuller understanding of the data
flow, we need to dig deeper by getting answers to the following 6 questions:

| Category          | Question                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Tools          | _What tools are we hoping to integrate?_                                                                                                                 |
| 2. Data flow      | _What data are we hoping to send between tools? Which direction does the data flow? What other tools, or humans are involved in facilitating this flow?_ |
| 3. Transformation | _Is there any data transformation taking place to make sure the integration goes smoothly?_                                                              |
| 4. Timing         | _What initiates this data flow?_                                                                                                                         |
| 5. Frequency      | _How often is this process happening?_                                                                                                                   |
| 6. Volume         | _What is the scale of this integration?_                                                                                                                 |

Using the above example, lets answer these questions one by one...

### Tools?

(work in progress)

<!-- This data flow involves CommCare and dhis2.  -->

### Data Flow?

(work in progress)

<!-- The data is flowing from CommCare -> Microsoft Excel -> dhis2. -->

### Transformation?

(work in progress)

<!-- It turns out that date formats in CommCare are mm/dd/yyyy, but the required date format for dhis2 in dd/mm/yyyy, so this integration will require dates to be reformatted before the data gets transmitted to dhis2. -->

### Timing?

(work in progress)

<!-- For this section we figure out what triggers this data flow? Is a real time integration required whenever a new CommCare form is submitted, or , or can we batch  -->

<!-- In this example the Ethiopian Ministry of Health refreshes the key indicator dashboards on a monthly basis, so the data flow can be batched and only needs to happen 1x per month.  -->

### Frequency?

(work in progress)

### Volume?

(work in progress)

<!-- Now that we have mapped out the data process comprehensively, we can easily analyze the process to figure out ways to streamline things, or even introduce some tools to
**automate** this integration. Did someone say the word **automate**? (Enter OpenFn from stage left) -->
